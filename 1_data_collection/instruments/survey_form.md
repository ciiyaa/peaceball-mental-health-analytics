# Girls' Wellbeing and Football Access Survey

This document explains the structure and logic of the survey used in the Peaceball project. The tool was designed for girls living in displacement camps and nearby schools in Zakho, many of whom are genocide survivors, with complex histories.

## What the Survey Measures

### 1. Emotional Wellbeing

Items that capture mood, energy, and the small markers of coping.

### 2. Social Connection

Questions about friendships and support, who they turn to, who listens, and whether they feel part of a group. In camps, these bonds are often fragile and essential.

### 3. Confidence & Agency

Short scales reflecting self-belief, comfort in trying new things, and how girls view their own abilities.

### 4. Football Participation

Whether they play, how often, and what stands in their way.
