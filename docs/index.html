Football gave them something to look forward to. Now I see them laughing, supporting each other, taking leadership roles. It's not just about the sport. It's about rebuilding their sense of who they are."

                    <blockquote>
                        "Since I was little, I've always wanted to be a football player. When I play, I feel like I'm flying - I love it beyond words. I started playing with friends at school. Then came displacement. In 2014, we found ourselves in camps, but we didn't stop - we played in the streets despite everything. When sport initiatives were launched to support girls, I seized the opportunity and took football courses. Today, I've gone from player to coach at Amal Academy in Sharya. I train both boys and girls, ages 10-18, for free. Watching them grow and improve? That's my greatest reward. Now I dream bigger - to provide more training programs. We're waiting for support to turn this dream into reality. Every girl deserves the chance to fly."

                    <p class="pitch-intro">We're seeking funding to launch a structured football program that addresses mental health and community cohesion in displacement contexts.</p>

                    <h4>The Evidence</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Program participants show <strong>2x higher wellbeing scores</strong> (82/100 vs 41/100)</li>
                        <li>Social support increases from 2.0/5 to 4.3/5 - a <strong>115% improvement</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>93.5% community support</strong> demonstrates strong buy-in</li>
                        <li>Effect sizes (d=4.6-5.9) far exceed typical psychosocial interventions</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Why This Works</h4>
                    <p>Unlike many programs, Peaceball starts with <strong>evidence</strong>. Our analysis of 270+ participants shows football participation correlates with substantial mental health improvements in displacement contexts. We're not guessing - we're scaling what data shows works.</p>

                    <h4>The Ask</h4>
                    <p>Funding for Phase 2: Program design, partnership building, and pilot implementation with built-in evaluation. We measure outcomes from day one and adapt based on data.</p>

                    <h4>ROI & Impact</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Low-cost intervention with high impact potential</li>
                        <li>Addresses mental health crisis in underserved populations</li>
                        <li>Builds community cohesion alongside individual wellbeing</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Non-participants scored in the <strong>clinical concern range</strong> for depression (WHO-5: 41/100)</li>

                        <li>Communities lack unifying activities that build collective identity</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Our Approach</h4>
                    <p>Peaceball combines structured sport programming with rigorous evaluation. Before launching, we analyzed outcomes from 102 girls and 168 community members. The data shows football participation associates with:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Wellbeing:</strong> Participants score 82/100 vs 41/100 for non-participants</li>
                        <li><strong>Social support:</strong> 4.3/5 vs 2.0/5</li>
