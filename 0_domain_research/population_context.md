# Population Context

## 1. Who This Study Focuses On

The **Peaceball Project** works with adolescent girls living in displacement camps in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq. Most come from families who survived the 2014 genocide in Shingal, while others arrived from different regions and religious backgrounds. Their histories are not identical, but they share a life shaped by long-term displacement, interrupted schooling, and limited access to public spaces.

They are between childhood and adulthood, negotiating responsibilities at home, safety expectations, and the unspoken weight carried by families rebuilding their lives.

## 2. Daily Realities That Shape Wellbeing

Life in the camps is defined by:

- crowded living arrangements  
- irregular access to education and services  
- limited private space  
- few structured activities designed for girls  
- mobility that is always negotiated  

These conditions influence not just leisure or routine but the sense of being seen, valued, and supported.

## 3. Participation and Non-Participation

Not all girls in these camps access football programs. This creates two groups within the same environment:

- **Participants**: girls who joined football activities through school or camp-based programs.
- **Non-participants**: girls who wanted to play, or were simply curious, but were held back by limited programme availability, safety concerns, social norms, or family responsibilities.

This project studies both groups to understand how access and lack of access shape wellbeing differently.

## 4. Broader Community Landscape

Zakho, where community football culture is strong, provides the backdrop. The city carries its own history of displacement and rebuilding, and its football identity influences how young people make sense of pride, belonging, and collective emotion.

Girls growing up inside the camps live close to this culture but rarely appear in its public narrative. This distance is part of the population reality the study addresses.
