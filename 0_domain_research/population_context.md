# Population Context

## 1. Two Study Populations

The **Peaceball Project** investigates two distinct but overlapping populations:

### Population 1: Displaced Adolescent Girls (Study 1)
Adolescent girls (ages 10-22) living in displacement camps in the Kurdistan Region. Most come from families who survived the 2014 Shingal genocide, while others arrived from different regions and religious backgrounds. They are between childhood and adulthood, negotiating responsibilities at home, safety expectations, and the weight of families rebuilding their lives.

### Population 2: Zakho Community Members (Study 2)
Residents of Zakho and surrounding areas across all ages and genders. Includes original Zakho residents, displaced populations living in the city, and those from other Kurdish regions. Captured during the FIFA Best Fan Award nomination period when community football pride was highly visible.

## 2. Study 1: Daily Realities in Displacement Camps

Life in the camps is defined by crowded living arrangements, irregular access to education and services, limited private space, few structured activities designed for girls, and mobility that is always negotiated. These conditions influence not just leisure or routine but the sense of being seen, valued, and supported.

## 3. Study 1: Participation and Non-Participation

Not all girls in these camps access football programs. This creates two groups within the same environment:

- **Participants**: girls who joined football activities through school or camp-based programs.
- **Non-participants**: girls who wanted to play, or were simply curious, but were held back by limited programme availability, safety concerns, social norms, or family responsibilities.

This project studies both groups to understand how access and lack of access shape wellbeing differently.

## 4. Study 2: Community Football Culture

Zakho carries a strong football identity that influences how residents make sense of pride, belonging, and collective emotion. The city has its own history of displacement and rebuilding, and football serves as a unifying cultural force.

The FIFA Best Fan Award nomination created a rare moment when this identity became globally visible. The community sentiment survey captured responses during this period across different demographics: age groups, genders, and residence statuses (original Zakho residents vs. displaced populations).

## 5. The Connection Between Populations

Girls growing up inside the camps live close to Zakho's football culture but rarely appear in its public narrative. This study measures both the visible community pride (Study 2) and the lived experiences of girls playing at the margins (Study 1) to understand whether these two realities connect.
