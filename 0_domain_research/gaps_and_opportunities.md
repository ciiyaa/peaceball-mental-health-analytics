# Gaps and Opportunities

## 1. What the Literature Misses

While sport and wellbeing have been studied across many displacement settings, and football fandom has been examined in post-conflict contexts, important gaps remain:

### Girls' Experiences (Study 1 Gaps):
- Displaced girls' experiences with football in Kurdistan/northern Iraq remain undocumented
- Informal, small-scale programs inside camps are rarely studied compared to large NGO initiatives
- How access (or lack of access) shapes wellbeing outcomes over time is poorly understood
- The relationship between girls' participation and the broader football culture surrounding them is unexplored

### Community Sentiment (Study 2 Gaps):
- Football fandom research focuses on men's experiences and professional club contexts
- Little is known about community sentiment during specific moments of international recognition (like FIFA nominations)
- How football pride affects different demographics (gender, age, displacement status) remains unclear
- The emotional functions of football in post-conflict Kurdistan specifically are undocumented

### Methodological Gaps:
- Mixed-method data connecting individual wellbeing with collective identity doesn't exist
- Studies rarely capture both scales (personal and communal) in the same landscape
- Region-specific research is needed rather than imported frameworks from other displacement contexts

These missing pieces create space for work grounded in Kurdistan's specific realities.

## 2. What the Peaceball Project Contributes

The project adds several elements rarely present together:

### Data from Two Scales:
- **Individual wellbeing data** from displaced girls, comparing participants and non-participants in football programs
- **Community sentiment data** captured during Zakho's FIFA Best Fan Award nomination, a historic moment of collective pride

### Contextual Depth:
- Grounded in the realities of families who survived the Shingal genocide
- Conducted in a landscape marked by long-term displacement and ongoing reconstruction
- Captures football culture in one of Iraq's strongest football cities

### Methodological Innovation:
- Two parallel datasets collected in the same timeframe and geographic region
- Allows investigation of whether community-level pride connects to individual-level experiences
- Mixed demographics across both studies enable comparison across gender, age, and displacement status

By holding these strands side by side, the project offers a more complete picture of what football makes possible in a post-conflict landscape.

## 3. Future Opportunities

This work opens doors to multiple directions:

### Program Development:
- Expand safe football access for displaced girls based on wellbeing findings
- Develop structured programs that link camp-based initiatives with Zakho's football clubs
- Create pathways for girls' visibility within the city's football narrative

### Research Extensions:
- Long-term tracking of wellbeing for girls participating in regular sport
- Deeper investigation of how community football sentiment influences youth identity
- Comparative studies across other displacement contexts in the Kurdistan Region
- Qualitative follow-up exploring girls' and community members' narratives in depth

### Community Engagement:
- Use community sentiment data to inform public programming around football events
- Community-led storytelling that brings girls' voices into Zakho's football identity
- Collaborations between schools, clubs, and camp-based initiatives

### Policy and Advocacy:
- Evidence-based recommendations for sport programming in displacement settings
- Documentation for humanitarian organizations working in the Kurdistan Region
- Advocacy for gender-equitable access to public space and sport

These opportunities are practical, scalable, and rooted in the region's existing strengths.
