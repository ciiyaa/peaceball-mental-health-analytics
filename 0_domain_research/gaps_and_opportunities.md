# Gaps and Opportunities

## 1. What the Literature Misses

While sport and wellbeing have been studied across many displacement settings, several gaps remain:

- the experiences of displaced girls in Kurdistan/northern Iraq  
- informal football programs that operate without large NGO structures  
- the emotional link between local football culture and girls’ sense of belonging  
- small, community-driven initiatives that grow inside camps  
- mixed-method data connecting individual wellbeing with collective identity  

These missing pieces create space for work that is grounded in the region rather than imported frameworks.

## 2. What the Peaceball Project Contributes

The project adds three things that are rarely present together:

- **Wellbeing data** from girls who play and those who cannot access programs  
- **Community sentiment** captured during a moment of collective pride in Zakho  
- **Contextual understanding** shaped by the realities of families who survived genocide, displacement, and ongoing reconstruction  

By holding these strands side by side, the project offers a more complete picture of what football makes possible in a landscape marked by instability and resilience.

## 3. Future Opportunities

This work opens the door to:

- long-term tracking of wellbeing for girls participating in regular sport  
- structured programs that expand safe access to football  
- collaborations between schools, clubs, and camp-based initiatives  
- deeper research on how football culture influences identity for displaced youth  
- community-led storytelling that brings girls’ voices into the public narrative  

These opportunities are practical, scalable, and rooted in the region’s existing strengths.
