# Domain Research: Football, Displacement, and Wellbeing in Zakho

This folder contains the foundational research and contextual documentation for the **Peaceball Project**, a dual-study investigation examining football's role in wellbeing and community identity in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq.

## Project Overview

The Peaceball Project investigates two interconnected questions:

1. **Individual Level**: How does football participation affect wellbeing among displaced adolescent girls living in camps?
2. **Community Level**: How does football fandom influence community sentiment, pride, and collective identity in Zakho?

These questions converged during Zakho's historic FIFA Best Fan Award nomination in 2025, creating a unique moment to measure both individual experiences (girls on the pitch) and collective emotion (community celebrating football identity).

## The Two Studies

### Study 1: Girls' Wellbeing & Football Participation
**Population**: Adolescent girls (10-22 years) in displacement camps
**Measures**: WHO-5 wellbeing, social connection, confidence, football access
**Dataset**: `girls_survey_anonymized.csv`

### Study 2: Community Sentiment During FIFA Nomination
**Population**: Zakho community members (all ages and genders)
**Measures**: Pride, emotional response to football, sense of belonging
**Dataset**: `community_survey_anonymized.csv`
**Context**: Captured during Zakho SC's FIFA Best Fan Award nomination period

- **[problem_space.md](problem_space.md)** - Key challenges: displacement conditions, access barriers, mental health service gaps, and knowledge gaps about girls and football.

### Evidence Base
- **[sport_and_wellbeing_evidence.md](sport_and_wellbeing_evidence.md)** - Global research on sport and adolescent wellbeing, with focus on displaced girls.

## Key Themes

- **Two scales, one landscape**: Individual wellbeing (girls) and collective identity (community) studied side by side
- **Zakho's FIFA moment**: Historic nomination created opportunity to measure community sentiment
- **Displacement as structure**: Not a crisis episode, but the framework of daily life
- **Access inequity**: Girls face barriers to public space and sport that boys typically don't
- **Invisible participants**: Girls playing in camps remain outside the public football narrative
- **Evidence gaps**: Existing research rarely studies displaced girls in Kurdistan or community sentiment in post-conflict football cultures

## Connection to Data Collection

The domain research directly informed:
- Survey design for both girls' wellbeing and community sentiment studies
- Question selection and scale choices (WHO-5, Likert scales)
- Sampling strategy (camp-based girls vs. community-wide sentiment)
- Timing (FIFA nomination period for community survey)
