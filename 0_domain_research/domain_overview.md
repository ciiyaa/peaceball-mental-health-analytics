## Football, Displacement, and Girls’ Wellbeing in the Kurdistan Region

## 1. Introduction

This project lives inside a simple question:  
> What does a safe space mean for a girl who has grown up with displacement as the background of her life?
> In displacement camps in Kurdistan, one of the unexpected answers is *football*.

This work sits at the meeting point of several realities: the wellbeing of young people shaped by displacement, the limited spaces available to girls, and the quiet power of community-based football in Kurdistan. It asks how structured and semi-structured football activities support girls in and around these camps, how they lift mood, build confidence, and create a sense of connection in places where stability is rarely guaranteed.

Zakho is a city in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, that carries the marks of repeated displacement and reconstruction, yet it remains known for its resilience and tightly woven social fabric. Daily life moves between a sense of endurance and a quiet determination to hold onto community identity. Football is one of the spaces where this identity becomes visible. When the city was nominated for the FIFA Best Fan Award, the response was immediate and collective. For a brief period, voting tents appeared across the streets, and the city moved with a shared sense of pride. Capturing community sentiment during this moment offers more than a snapshot of enthusiasm. It reveals how belonging, memory, and emotional life take shape in a post-conflict setting, and how football continues to anchor people to one another.

These two threads form the foundation of the ***Peaceball Project***.

## 2. The Setting

The Kurdistan Region hosts thousands of families living in displacement for years at a time. Adolescents grow up inside these conditions: interrupted schooling, limited access to recreation, and the steady weight of uncertainty.

For girls, the boundaries are even narrower. Movement is negotiated. Safety is always a concern. Public space is rarely designed for them. Any effort to understand their wellbeing must begin from these lived constraints, not abstract assumptions.

## 3. Why Football Matters Here

Football is more than a sport in this region. It is a shared language and a familiar rhythm in an unpredictable environment. On the pitch, girls step into a space that feels briefly free and self-directed. They move. They compete. They learn. They belong.

In Zakho, football carries a particular emotional weight. The enthusiasm surrounding the FIFA Best Fan nomination revealed how deeply the community ties itself to its club. In a place marked by repeated disruption and rebuilding, this sense of collective identity matters.

This cultural grounding makes football an ideal lens for studying wellbeing in a displacement context.

## 4. What the Evidence Suggests

Across different displacement settings, studies from Uganda, Lebanon, Jordan, and the Kurdistan Region point to a consistent pattern. When delivered with care, sport has the potential to support psychosocial wellbeing through:

- improved mood and emotional regulation  
- renewed routine and structure  
- stronger peer relationships  
- increased confidence through skill and mastery  
- a shared identity that counters isolation  

Despite this emerging evidence, important gaps remain:

- very little research focuses specifically on displaced girls in the Kurdistan Region,
- few studies examine community-based football rather than formal NGO programmes  
- almost no work explores football fandom as an emotional and social space  
- limited mixed-method research combining validated scales, short surveys, and narrative insights  

These gaps shape the relevance of this project.

## 5. Why This Project Fits Here

***Peaceball*** was designed inside a narrow window that combined urgency, opportunity, and context. It brings together two vantage points:

1. the lived experiences of displaced girls who participate in football and those who do not  
2. the wider emotional landscape captured during Zakho’s FIFA Best Fan campaign  

Together, these perspectives show how football operates both personally and communally. The project does not aim to claim large-scale transformation. Instead, it traces smaller shifts: a moment of confidence, a sense of ease, the feeling of being part of something recognizable and shared.

These subtle movements often mark the beginning of stronger wellbeing.

## 6. Purpose of This Overview

This document anchors the broader domain study. It outlines the local setting, the cultural significance of football, the existing evidence, and the gaps that give this work its direction.

The files in this folder build on this foundation, offering population context, mechanisms of impact, comparative findings, and research gaps. Together, they ensure that any reader can understand not only the output of the ***Peaceball*** project, but the landscape that made the work necessary.
