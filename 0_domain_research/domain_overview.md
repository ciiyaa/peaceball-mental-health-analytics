## Football, Displacement, and Girls’ Wellbeing in the Kurdistan Region

## 1. Introduction

This project lives inside a simple question:

> What does a safe space mean for a girl whose childhood has unfolded against the backdrop of displacement?

In displacement camps across the Kurdistan Region, one of the unexpected answers is football. It offers a small world of movement, routine, and shared energy in places where life is often shaped by uncertainty. When spaces are build for girls to play, something shifts. The pitch becomes a place where they can move without hesitation, test their strength, and form connections that feel natural rather than supervised.

Zakho shows this in a different way. When the city's football community was nominated for the FIFA Best Fan Award 2025, people responded with an instinctive sense of pride. Voting tents appeared across streets. Families gathered. That moment revealed how football holds memory, belonging, and identity together in a post-conflict landscape, and it raised a quieter question: ***If an entire city can find pride through football, what happens for the girls playing on small pitches at the camps' edges?***

These two spaces, the pitch where girls play, and the city where football lives as collective identity frame the heart of the **Peaceball Project.**

## 2. The Setting

Families in the Kurdistan Region's displacement camps carry long histories of loss and rebuilding. Many fled the 2014 genocide in Shingal. Others come from different regions, religions, and traditions. Their stories are distinct, yet they meet in the same landscape of temporary shelters, limited services, and years spent waiting for a stable future.

Zakho itself sits at this intersection. The city hosts both long-term displaced populations and a deeply rooted local community. It has rebuilt itself repeatedly and carries both resilience and exhaustion. Adolescents growing up here navigate interrupted schooling, restricted mobility, and the emotional weight that accumulates in families shaped by trauma.

For girls especially, access to public space is narrow and often negotiated. Understanding their wellbeing begins with this reality.

## 3. Why Football Matters Here

Football is everywhere in Kurdistan. It is one of the communal spaces where age, background, and religion briefly fall away. Boys play in every alley. Men gather in cafes to watch matches. But for girls, access is different.When girls do get to play, for example in programs run by organizations working inside displacement camps, the pitch becomes something rare:
> "A place where I can be loud, competitive, free. Where I can fail without judgment and succeed with celebration." — Shukriya Haji Malo, 16 y.o

The FIFA Best Fan nomination made visible what football already means to Zakho's identity. But it also exposed a gap: while the city celebrates its football culture, the girls playing in the camps remain largely invisible to that same narrative. This project sits in that gap

## 4. What This Study Does

The **Peaceball Project** conducts two parallel investigations:

### Study 1: Girls' Wellbeing & Football Participation
Measures emotional wellbeing, social connection, and confidence among displaced adolescent girls in camps. Compares participants in football programs with non-participants to understand how access shapes wellbeing differently.

**Research Question**: Does football participation improve wellbeing outcomes for displaced girls?

### Study 2: Community Sentiment During FIFA Nomination
Captures community pride, emotional response, and sense of belonging during Zakho SC's FIFA Best Fan Award nomination. Measures how football fandom influences collective identity across age, gender, and displacement status.

**Research Question**: How does football culture shape community sentiment in a post-conflict setting?

### The Connection
By holding both scales—the personal (girls on the pitch) and the collective (community celebrating football)—this study asks: ***What does football make possible in a place rebuilding from conflict?***

The two datasets reveal whether the pride visible at the city level reaches the girls playing at the camps' edges, and whether their experiences connect to the larger football identity that defines Zakho.
