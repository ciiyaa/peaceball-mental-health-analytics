## Research Gaps and Challenges in Understanding Football, Displacement, and Wellbeing

## 1. Long-term Displacement as Daily Structure

This study doesn't focus on trauma itself. It focuses on what comes after: years spent in temporary arrangements that have become permanent. For adolescents growing up in camps, displacement is not an episode—it is the structure of daily life. Girls experience this more narrowly than most, with routines shaped by safety concerns, restricted mobility, and expectations that keep them close to home.

## 2. The Access Problem

Girls face barriers to public space and sport that boys typically don't: cultural norms, safety concerns, family responsibilities, inconsistent programming, and funding cycles that make safe spaces temporary. Access itself is filtered before preference or interest is even expressed. This study compares participants and non-participants to understand how differential access shapes wellbeing outcomes.

## 3. The Mental Health Service Gap

Mental health services in displacement camps focus mostly on crisis response: PTSD treatment, emergency counseling, family mediation. Long-term emotional needs, the kind that don't present as emergencies but accumulate quietly, are often managed privately, inside families that are already carrying their own trauma.

For many girls, daily life offers little privacy, few outlets, and almost no spaces that feel reliably their own. This leaves a quiet gap, not the absence of treatment, but the absence of places where girls can form confidence, friendships, and routine outside of crisis frameworks.

Football programs exist in this gap. They're not therapy, but they create conditions that matter for wellbeing, physical movement, peer connection, consistent routine, and moments of joy that don't require explanation or intervention.

## 4. Knowledge Gaps This Study Addresses

Football is everywhere in Kurdistan. Zakho's FIFA Best Fan nomination made that visible globally. Yet key questions remain unanswered:

### About Girls (Study 1):
- What do girls experience on the pitch that they cannot access elsewhere?
- How does participation shape wellbeing, confidence, and belonging over time?
- What prevents non-participants from joining?

### About Community (Study 2):
- How does football fandom influence community sentiment in post-conflict settings?
- Does community pride during moments like FIFA nominations affect different groups (gender, age, displacement status) differently?
- What emotional functions does football serve for people rebuilding from conflict?

### About the Connection:
- Do girls connect their own play to the larger football culture they see around them?
- Does the pride visible at the city level reach the girls playing at the camps' edges?
