## What Limits Wellbeing and Access for Displaced Girls in Kurdistan

## 1. Living Inside Long-term Displacement

Many families in the Kurdistan Region's displacement camps are genocide survivors from Shingal. Others arrived from different areas and faiths, each carrying their own histories of loss.

But this study doesn't focus on trauma itself. It focuses on what comes after: the slow, grinding reality of years spent in temporary arrangements that have become permanent. For adolescents growing up here, displacement is not an episode. It is the structure of daily life.

Girls experience this more narrowly than most. Their routines are shaped by safety concerns, restricted mobility, and expectations that keep them close to home. Opportunities for movement, ease, or peer connection are limited and irregular.

## 2. The Access Problem

While boys may access informal play spaces across the region, empty lots, alleys, school yards, girls often cannot. Cultural norms, safety concerns, and family responsibilities create barriers that are both practical and deeply internalized.

Even when programs exist, they are inconsistent:

- Safe spaces for girls are scarce and temporary.
- Programs appear and disappear based on funding cycles.
- Household responsibilities consume time and energy.
- Public spaces do not feel designed for them.

These conditions shape what girls can participate in long before preference or interest is even expressed. This study measures wellbeing among the girls who did gain access, but it's important to name that access itself is already filtered.

## 3. The Mental Health Service Gap

Mental health services in displacement camps focus mostly on crisis response: PTSD treatment, emergency counseling, family mediation. Long-term emotional needs, the kind that don't present as emergencies but accumulate quietly, are often managed privately, inside families that are already carrying their own trauma.

For many girls, daily life offers little privacy, few outlets, and almost no spaces that feel reliably their own. This leaves a quiet gap, not the absence of treatment, but the absence of places where girls can form confidence, friendships, and routine outside of crisis frameworks.

Football programs exist in this gap. They're not therapy, but they create conditions that matter for wellbeing, physical movement, peer connection, consistent routine, and moments of joy that don't require explanation or intervention.

## 4. What We Don't Know About Girls and Football

Football is everywhere in Kurdistan. Zakho's FIFA Best Fan nomination made that visible on a global stage. But the girls playing in displacement camps remain outside that visibility. Key questions have never been answered:

- What do girls experience on the pitch that they cannot access elsewhere?
- What prevents others from joining?
- How does participation shape confidence or belonging over time?
- Do girls connect their own play to the larger football culture they see around them, the matches, the pride, the identity?

Without these answers, the value of football for displaced girls remains assumed rather than understood.
