## Power and Sensitivity Analyses

### Post-Hoc Power Analysis

**Study 1 - Primary Outcomes**

WHO-5 Wellbeing (d = 5.13, n1=79, n2=23):
- Achieved power: >0.999 (>99.9%)

Social Support (d = 5.86, n1=79, n2=23):
- Achieved power: >0.999 (>99.9%)

Self-Confidence (d = 4.64, n1=79, n2=23):
- Achieved power: >0.999 (>99.9%)

**Sample size for different effects (equal groups, 80% power)**:

Social Support: 0 outliers detected
Self-Confidence: 0 outliers detected

**Z-score method (|z| > 3)**

Original p-values: all p < 0.001

Bonferroni (α = 0.017): All remain significant
Holm-Bonferroni: All remain significant
FDR (Benjamini-Hochberg): All remain significant

**Alpha level sensitivity**:

## Additional Notes

### Effect Size Interpretation

Cohen's d benchmarks:
- Small: d = 0.20
- Medium: d = 0.50
- Large: d = 0.80

Our effects (d = 4.64-5.86) are approximately 6-7 times "large" threshold.

### Confidence Interval Interpretation

All 95% CIs for effect sizes exclude zero by large margins, indicating precise estimates despite unequal group sizes.

### Limitations

1. Cross-sectional design precludes causal inference
2. Self-selection bias likely inflates effect sizes
3. Non-participants show unusually low wellbeing (possible high-risk group)
4. Small non-participant sample (n=23) limits subgroup analyses
5. Community sample may over-represent football fans
6. Social desirability bias possible in both studies

### Strengths

1. Complete case analysis (minimal missing data)
2. Appropriate non-parametric tests when assumptions violated
3. Effect sizes with confidence intervals reported throughout
4. Multiple comparison corrections applied
5. Sensitivity analyses confirm robustness
6. Adequate power for observed large effects
