# Results

This document presents findings from two interconnected studies examining the psychosocial impact of the Peaceball football program on displaced adolescent girls and community sentiment toward the Zakho FC team during its FIFA recognition campaign.

## Sample Characteristics

### Study 1: Adolescent Girls (N = 102)

**Program Participation:**
Seventy-nine girls (77.5%) participated in the Peaceball football program, while 23 (22.5%) did not participate. All participants were displaced residents living in camps or informal settlements.

**Age Distribution:**
Participants ranged from 13-22 years old, distributed across three age groups:
- 13-15 years: n = 45 (44.1%)
- 16-18 years: n = 37 (36.3%)
- 19-22 years: n = 20 (19.6%)

Program participants skewed slightly younger, with 50.6% in the 13-15 age group compared to 21.7% of non-participants (*χ*² = 7.94, *p* = .019).

**Displacement Duration:**
Nearly all participants (98.0%) had been displaced for more than 3 years. Only two program participants reported displacement duration of 2-3 years. This homogeneity reflects the protracted nature of displacement in the region.

**School Enrollment:**
The majority (94.1%) were enrolled in school. School enrollment was slightly higher among program participants (92.4%) compared to non-participants (100%), though this difference was not statistically significant given the small sample size.

### Study 2: Community Members (N = 60)

**Gender:**
The community sample included 36 males (60.0%) and 24 females (40.0%), representing a range of age groups within the Zakho displaced community.

**Residence Status:**
Participants were categorized into three groups based on their connection to Zakho:
- Originally from Zakho: n = 22 (36.7%)
- Displaced to Zakho: n = 30 (50.0%)
- Other connection: n = 8 (13.3%)

**Age Groups:**
Community participants ranged across adult age categories, with representation from young adults (18-25 years) through older adults (45+ years), ensuring diverse generational perspectives on football fandom and collective identity.

## Study 1: Impact of Football Program on Adolescent Wellbeing

### Primary Outcomes

**WHO-5 Wellbeing Index:**
Program participants reported significantly higher wellbeing scores (*M* = 82.13, *SD* = 10.79) compared to non-participants (*M* = 40.70, *SD* = 3.75), *U* = 0.00, *p* < .001, Cohen's *d* = 5.13, 95% CI [4.27, 5.98]. This represents an exceptionally large effect size, with participants scoring more than 4 standard deviations higher than non-participants.

For context, WHO-5 scores below 50 suggest poor wellbeing and indicate need for depression screening. Non-participants' mean score of 40.70 falls in this clinical concern range, while participants' mean of 82.13 indicates good mental health. Published norms for adolescents suggest scores above 70 reflect positive wellbeing.

**Social Support Index:**
Participants reported substantially higher perceived social support (*M* = 4.31, *SD* = 0.52) compared to non-participants (*M* = 1.99, *SD* = 0.16), *U* = 0.00, *p* < .001, *d* = 5.86, 95% CI [4.94, 6.77]. On the 1-5 scale, participants averaged above 4 ("agree") while non-participants averaged near 2 ("disagree"), indicating fundamental differences in social connectedness.

**Self-Confidence Index:**
Similarly, participants demonstrated higher self-confidence (*M* = 4.16, *SD* = 0.61) than non-participants (*M* = 2.07, *SD* = 0.14), *U* = 0.00, *p* < .001, *d* = 4.64, 95% CI [3.85, 5.42]. This large effect suggests program participation is associated with meaningful improvements in self-efficacy and personal capability beliefs.

### Correlational Patterns Among Wellbeing Components

Correlation analyses among program participants revealed moderate to strong associations between wellbeing components (see Figure 4). WHO-5 items showed intercorrelations ranging from *r* = .42 to *r* = .68 (all *p*s < .001), suggesting they tap related but distinct aspects of wellbeing.

Social support and self-confidence indices were moderately correlated (*r* = .56, *p* < .001), suggesting these psychosocial benefits develop together. Both indices showed moderate associations with specific WHO-5 items:
- Social support correlated most strongly with feeling cheerful (*r* = .61) and interested (*r* = .58)
- Self-confidence correlated most strongly with feeling active (*r* = .64) and rested (*r* = .59)

These patterns suggest the program may support wellbeing through multiple pathways: fostering social connections that enhance positive mood, and building confidence that promotes energy and engagement.

### Statistical and Practical Significance

The effect sizes observed in this study (*d* = 4.64 to 5.86) far exceed conventional thresholds for "large" effects (*d* = 0.8). While such extreme effect sizes are unusual in psychosocial research, several factors may explain these findings:

1. **Selection effects:** Participants self-selected into the program, potentially reflecting pre-existing differences in family support, motivation, or opportunity.

2. **Comparison group characteristics:** Non-participants represent a particularly vulnerable subgroup, with wellbeing scores suggesting clinical-level distress.

3. **Genuine program impact:** The combination of physical activity, team sport participation, and structured programming in a displacement context may produce substantial benefits.

4. **Measurement considerations:** The cross-sectional design cannot establish causality. Longitudinal data would clarify whether low wellbeing predicts non-participation or participation improves wellbeing.

Despite these interpretive caveats, the magnitude and consistency of differences across multiple outcomes suggest meaningful associations between program participation and psychosocial wellbeing in this displaced adolescent population.
