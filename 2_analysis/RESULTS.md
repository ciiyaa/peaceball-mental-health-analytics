This document presents findings from two interconnected studies examining the psychosocial impact of the Peaceball football program on displaced adolescent girls and community sentiment toward the Zakho FC team during its FIFA recognition campaign.

## Sample Characteristics

### Study 1: Adolescent Girls (N = 102)

**Program Participation:**
Seventy-nine girls (77.5%) participated in the Peaceball football program, while 23 (22.5%) did not participate. All participants were displaced residents living in camps or informal settlements.

**Age Distribution:**
Participants ranged from 13-22 years old, distributed across three age groups:
- 13-15 years: n = 45 (44.1%)
- 16-18 years: n = 37 (36.3%)
- 19-22 years: n = 20 (19.6%)

Program participants skewed slightly younger, with 50.6% in the 13-15 age group compared to 21.7% of non-participants (*χ*² = 7.94, *p* = .019).

**Displacement Duration:**
Nearly all participants (98.0%) had been displaced for more than 3 years. Only two program participants reported displacement duration of 2-3 years. This homogeneity reflects the protracted nature of displacement in the region.

**School Enrollment:**
The majority (94.1%) were enrolled in school. School enrollment was slightly higher among program participants (92.4%) compared to non-participants (100%), though this difference was not statistically significant given the small sample size.

### Study 2: Community Members (N = 60)

**Gender:**
The community sample included 36 males (60.0%) and 24 females (40.0%), representing a range of age groups within the Zakho displaced community.

**Residence Status:**
Participants were categorized into three groups based on their connection to Zakho:
- Originally from Zakho: n = 22 (36.7%)
- Displaced to Zakho: n = 30 (50.0%)
- Other connection: n = 8 (13.3%)

**Age Groups:**
Community participants ranged across adult age categories, with representation from young adults (18-25 years) through older adults (45+ years), ensuring diverse generational perspectives on football fandom and collective identity.
